#' Growth of yeast population under a serial dilution regime, based on Dai et al 2012 Science paper
#' @param n_t The current population size
#' @param t Number of hours between serial dilutions
#' @param epsilon random shock for dilution. Note: only applied
#'  once per dilution (e.g once per function call)
#' @param theta parameters for the model; defaults to estimates from Dai et al; see details
#' @param DF Dilution factor, the environmental variable manipulated to cause the bifurcation
#' @return the population size the next day, after serial dilution and growth
#' @details 
#' Dai et al model:
#' 
#' $n_{t+1} = n_t g(n_t + \\epsilon n_t, \\theta)$
#' $g(n_t) = n_{t+1} / n_t$
#' 
#' From the supplement of Dai et al (2012), Science:
#' "This model is based on two phases of daily
#' growth: a slow exponential growth phase at low cell densities, followed by a logistic growth
#' phase with a higher per capita growth rate at intermediate cell densities. This model has 5
#' parameters: T lag is the lag time before yeast cells start to grow after being transferred into new
#' media (the total time for daily growth is 23 hours). In the slow exponential phase, the population
#' grows with a constant per capita growth rate gamma_low . After the population reaches a threshold
#' density N_c , the subsequent logistic growth is determined by gamma_high (gamma_high > gamma_low) and the carrying
#' capacity K"
